# Galaxy-Zoo-CNN
Galaxy Classification using CNN


Hi! As a demanding public outreach for introducing astrophysics, galaxy zoo is a starter pack. Classifying galaxies based on images is a basic astronomer's visual skill. 

By the Hubble tuning fork, galaxies could be classified as below.

As now, the classifier could only returns elliptical, irregular, and spiral type (on develoment for broader datasets).

# Example
As expected (and sometimes not), it will returned the galaxy's type.

# Source
The datasets were taken from google search and SDSS. 

The CNN was derived from notebook in deeplearning.ai's Tensorflow course, available at https://github.com/lmoroney/dlaicourse/blob/master/Course%202%20-%20Part%208%20-%20Lesson%202%20-%20Notebook%20(RockPaperScissors).ipynb
